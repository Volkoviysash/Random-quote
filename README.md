# Random quote machine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About app

Here you can generate some random quote of some great thinker and add it to your twitter or instagram story.
If quote is not as beautiful and great as you proposed, you can regenerate it using "Generate new" button.

## Buttons

If you liked how the quote sounds or looks you can tweet it clicking the "Twitter" button. Then in a new tab will open twitter site with completed tweet-form.

Also you can add the screenshot to your instagram, but in this case button will target you on your instagram account and you should make the screenshot to add this quote in your profile.

Button "Create new" will generate new quote and will change the background color
